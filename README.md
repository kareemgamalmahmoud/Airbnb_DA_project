> Airbnb provides [open data](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) that quantifies the impact of short-term rentals on housing and residential communities; and also provides a platform to support advocacy for policies to protect our cities from the impacts of short-term rentals. 

> By analyzing publicly available information about a city's Airbnb's listings, Inside Airbnb provides filters and key metrics so you can see how Airbnb is being used to compete with the residential housing market.

> Note : We have provided the data for Toronto. 

> But, if you prefer, you can work on data from other cities on the [website](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/). Here is the description of available data.

> In this [Overleaf link](https://www.overleaf.com/read/yvsfqxkcjspk), we will explain everything from A to z in terms of describing the data and models used.
